            <div class="wish-right">
                <div class="wish-right-content">I know  this website looks so lame, cliche and weird or not a good palette of colors used, cause there are no fucking templates for a birthday website on Pinterest, so am I the first person to get an idea of wishing somebody a happy birthday through a custom website, may be, so aren't you glad YOU are the person who received it???? 
                    <br>
                    You should've been there to design me a layout at least, think how much I would've struggled to choose colors and fonts and content and layout and what else a birthday website might need. It was hard cause I had to please you and not myself when I am doing this.
                    <br>
                    Am I just talking about the Website and not the birthday Wish?
                    <br>
                    Well then I guess it's just 12:00AM to 12:05AM right now if you chose to prioritize me but if you're opening the link and reading it after 12:05AM then go FUCK OFF. You should've known that I want to be the first person to wish you a HAPPY BIRTHDAY. 
                    <br>
                    But who knows again, there might be other important people for you, go tell them all thanks and come back to me. Remember YOU are my important people.
                    <br>
                    So I wish you the HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY, the 21<sup>st</sup> birthday, I hope you'll forever stay Happy and not let anything, anybody and even me ruin your happiness. If I fucking see you sad today, you'll die I am telling you.
